A site to act as a testing ground of sorts before posting this to my public facing site for work.

Looking to post about Cyber sec stuff, Digital forensics, and homelab stuff. Overall this site it to hone my skills and make sure I don't look dumb on the site i'll post on LinkedIn. If that helps someone out that'd be great too!

If anything on my site is messed up or you want to know more leave a comment IDK how often i'll check this site but i'd love to see that it helped someone.
